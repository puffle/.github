### 👤 About

Puffle is a free, open source and self-hostable "*any game*" server emulator that was born as a [Yukon](https://github.com/wizguin/yukon-server) experiment.  
This code will be used as a reference for the next major version of Yukon, taking full advantage of TypeScript and all the new implemented improvements.
